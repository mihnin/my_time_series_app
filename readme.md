## üöÄ Live Demo & Technical Guide

This section provides all the necessary information to run the application locally and test its functionality.

### Technical Stack
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, AutoGluon (for automated machine learning)
* **Core Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Frontend:** Vue.js
* **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1.  Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
    ```sh
    cd my_time_series_app
    ```

2.  Run all services with a single command:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

* After building and launching:
    * **Frontend** will be available at: `http://localhost:4173`
    * **Backend (API)** will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

> **Note:** After opening the application for the first time, set up a secret word. This will be used for configuring the database connection later. To do this, select advanced user settings, go to DB connection settings, and enter the secret word.

### Application Usage (User Guide)

#### 1. Connect to a Database (Optional)
* To load data from or save results to a database, connect to PostgreSQL using the button in the top-right corner.
* Enter your username and password, then test the connection.

#### 2. Load Data
* **From a file:** Click "Choose File" and upload a CSV/Excel file.
* **From a database:** After connecting, select a schema and table, then click "Load Data from DB".

#### 3. Select Columns for Training
* You must select:
    * The **date** column
    * The **ID** column
    * The **target variable** column
* (Optional) You can also select **static features**.

#### 4. Configure Parameters
* **Data frequency:** auto/day/month/hour, etc.
* **Method for filling missing values:** default is Forward fill.
* **Quality metric:** Choose a metric to evaluate model performance.
* **Models:** AutoGluon is recommended for automatic model selection.
* **Training time limit:** Set a time limit for the training process.
* **Prediction horizon:** Define the forecast period (days/weeks/months).

#### 5. Start Training
* Click "Start Training". The progress will be displayed on the screen.
* Upon completion, a table with results and a model leaderboard will appear.

#### 6. Get Forecast
* Click "Make Forecast". The results will be displayed in a table and on charts.
* You can download the forecast as an Excel/CSV file or save it to the database.

#### 7. Additional Features
